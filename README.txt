This is a simple take on Super Mario Bros. The game creates a 2d array of a mario level complete with coins, mushrooms, goombas, koopas, a warp pipe
and a boss. Mario randomly moves in a randomly generated direction and interacts with the element in the level array. Mario can collect coins, power
ups and defeat enemies. Mario must defeat the boss or find the warp pipe to move onto the next level and save the princess!
